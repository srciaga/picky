# Picky
Not sure what movie to watch next? Too many books in your TBR pile? Picky.py is a simple Python script that lets you add items to lists and picks a random one for you.  
**Features**: Text-based (run in the CLI), get random item, see list of items, add item to list, remove item from list, switch to a different category.

## Installation
Once you've downloaded the latest release, you must install the required module. This script uses [PyInputPlus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/). To download it, navigate to the project's directory and use the following command:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the script:

```
python3 picky.py
```

## Possible Future Improvements
- [x] Choose between different lists (e.g. one for books, another for movies, etc)
- [ ] Show all existing lists
- [ ] Add a GUI

### Notes
This is the first Python program I've written from scratch. :)
