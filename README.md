# Picky
Too many books in your TBR pile? Picky.py is a simple Python script that lets you add books to a list and picks a random one for you. 

## Installation
Once you've downloaded the project, you must install the required module. This script uses [PyInputPlus](https://pypi.org/project/PyInputPlus/). To download it, navigate to the project's directory and use the following command.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, use the following command to run the script.

```
python3 bookpicker.py
```

## Possible Future Improvements
- [ ] Choose between different lists (e.g. one for books, another for movies, etc)
- [ ] Add a GUI

### Notes
This is the first Python program I've written from scratch. :)
